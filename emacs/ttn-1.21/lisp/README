This directory has elisp code for ttn environment.
Most useful code is autoloaded.  See admin.el for more info.

Below is reformatted "grep -n Description *.el" and here is code that does it:

;; Make sure buffer is writeable, then put cursor [HERE] and do
;; `M-x eval-defun RET'.  Don't forget to save!
(save-excursion
  (re-search-forward "^-+\n")
  (insert "# " (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name)) " ends here\n")
  (delete-region (point) (point-max))
  (goto-char (match-end 0))
  (shell-command "grep -n Description *.el" t)
  (when noninteractive
    (count-lines-region (point) (point-max)))
  (while (re-search-forward ".el:[0-9]+:;+ Description:" nil t)
    (replace-match "\n") (end-of-line) (insert "\n")))
