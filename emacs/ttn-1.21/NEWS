This file contains news, mostly user-visible but sometimes also programming.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.21 -- 1998/09/27

- Individual source-file dependencies are now captured using the `require' and
  `provide' mechanisms.

- The command `M-x emacs-uptime' displays in the mode line when Emacs was
  started and a breakdown in terms of days, hours, minutes and seconds.  Also
  displayed are the numbers of buffers and files.

- The command `M-x make' is now an alias to `M-x compile'.

- The Verilog mode is now implemented using verilog-mode.el by Michael
  McNamara <mac@surefirev.com>.  The old verilog.el is no longer distributed
  with this library.

- The imported package `edbm' is no longer distributed with this library.

- The `hideshow' package now does state save/restore.

  When in programming modes, hideshow is configured to save state on buffer
  kill as well as to not hide comments when doing `hs-hide-all'.

- The `adhoc' feature is now available.  See the files adhoc.el and
  adhoc.adhoc for more info.

- The variable `C-l-gravity' which controls how the screen is redrawn when
  `C-l' is pressed is now dependent on window height.

- A bug was fixed in the administrative macro `ttn-with-RCS-file', whereby the
  free variable `file' was being set incorrectly.  This change does not affect
  users.

- The command `print-buffer-local-variables' now uses `pp', a pretty printer.

- The variable `custom-file', which names the file where the custom.el keeps
  its state, used to name a file in the home directory.  This is now renamed
  `ttn-elisp-home'/lisp/customized-state.el, part of ttn's personal elisp
  library.  This change is to facilitate export.

- The variable `bookmark-default-file', which names the file where bookmark.el
  keeps its state, used to name a file in the home directory.  This is now
  renamed `ttn-elisp-home'/lisp/bookmarks.bmk, part of ttn's personal elisp
  library.  This change is to facilitate export.

- RMAIL is no longer supported as the preferred mail reader.  Instead, there
  is now support for the VM mail reader.  The key sequence `C-x r' no longer
  runs the command `rmail'.  The sequence `C-x v m' now runs `vm'.  (You can
  also do `Mx vm'.)

  In VM, keys have been rebound.  Here is a list (old keys in parens):
    x	vm-expunge-folder    (#)
    s	vm-save-folder	     (S)
    o	vm-save-message	     (s)

- For sending mail, when the variable `ttn-jammed-from' is bound to a string,
  that value is jammed in the "Reply-to:" header, but only if a "Reply-to"
  header is not already in set in the buffer.  This jamming support has also
  been added to `mail-send-hook'.

- The variable `view-scroll-auto-exit' is now `t', which means that when
  viewing a file (or buffer), scrolling past the end will exit the buffer
  instead of signalling an error.

- The administrative macro `ttn-with-RCS-file' is now autoloaded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.20 -- 1998/08/20

- The command `xscreensaver-command-deactivate' is no longer available.  A new
  command `xscreensaver-command-restart' is available.  The general command
  `xscreensaver-command' now takes a string of args to pass.

- A new command `find-files' calls find(1) and then allows interactive file
  selection.  Selection is similar to `query-replace': `y' or `SPC' accepts;
  `n' or `DEL' rejects; `.' accepts one then stops; `!' accepts the rest and
  `q' quits.  The command asks for a wildcard to pass to find(1).

- The command `reset-x-bell' now consults ~/.xsession-common instead of
  ~/.xsession.

- Using `makefile-mode' calls `my-prog-env', which now handles source wrapping
  for that mode correctly.

- The list displayed by `munge-root-window' handles the new `bg-shell-command'
  buffer name convention.

- A bug was fixed in `fortunate-loop' that relies on this library's binding
  for `M->'.

- The `bury-buffer' command for `M-_' now understands prefix arg to rename the
  buffer by prefixing a space.  This makes `electric-buffer-list' not notice
  it.  To see the buffer, use `C-x b SPC' and then one or more TABs to invoke
  completion.

- In programming modes, the key `f10' is now bound to the same command as the
  sequence `C-c M-C-h'.  This command does "here" searching.  See below for
  its introduction.

- The buffer created by `bg-shell-command' now has a name that is easier to
  read.  The buffer name is made from: "*bg job* CMD".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.19 -- 1998/07/06

- The AUTHORS file in the distribution now attributes the authors for imported
  source (stuff under lisp/import).

- When reading mail, headers that begin w/ "Resent-" are now not initially
  shown.  You can toggle showing all the headers by using the `t' command.

- A new command `run-guile-gtk' is available.  It, predictably, runs
  guile-gtk in a new buffer named "*guile-gtk*".

- The command `print-previous-revision', useful for files under version
  control, now takes care to render RCS tags in the file immutable.  This
  makes the buffer where the file is rendered safer in some senses.

- The new command `C-l-gravity' sets the var `C-l-gravity' to whatever
  window-line point is currently at.  This makes adapting `C-l' behavior to
  different situations very easy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.18 -- 1998/06/02

- Running the normal hook `hs-minor-mode-hook' (when turning on hideshow minor
  mode) now binds `C-c L' to `hs-hide-level', `C-c o' to `hs-save-state', and
  `C-c i' to `hs-restore-state'.

  More fundamentally, the hideshow in this library (latest: 4.12) is now based
  off of the one distributed in FSF Emacs 20.2.  Modifications have been made
  to re-enable state save/restore and `hs-hide-level'.

- A bug was fixed in the auto-editing amusement (invoked by `M-x ae') that
  caused it not to run at all.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.17 -- 1998/05/06

- Fix bug in command `set-font-at-point' which was causing whitespace in the
  buffer to be improperly considered as part of the font name.

- The source file base64.el is now named ttn-base64.el so that w3-mode (in
  xemacs, and with its own base64.el) would work.  (This mode provides a www
  browser and other services.)

- The PLL spreadsheet now has a parameter `b-range' to indicate the binning
  range (in MHz).

- The `home' and `end' keys have been rebound to `delete-other-windows' and
  `delete-window', respectively, and `pause' does `split-window-vertically'.

- The startup behavior of changing directory to `~' and finding ~/.todo is now
  disabled.  Whatever directory you are in will be the default one.

- Mouse button 3 on the modeline now does what `C-x C-k' does, namely, kills
  the buffer and closes the window.  If a prefix arg is given, the buffer is
  instead buried.

- The new command `clone-frame' creates another frame with the same properties
  as the current one.  The related command `clone-frame-just-text' works in a
  similar way, but the new frame does not have a minibuffer (the bottom-most
  line is the mode-line).

- The new command `toggle-case-fold-search' controls whether or not searches
  (eg, those started using `C-s') should be case sensitive.  This command
  toggles the variable `case-fold-search', which when t makes searching case
  insensitive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.16 -- 1998/02/16

- The new variable `ttn-select-global-keys' controls what global keys are
  rebound when loading keys.el.  Briefly, two forms are recognized:
	(only KEY1 KEY2 ...)
  and	(except KEY1 KEY2 ...)

  These forms permit and restrict, respectively, rebinding for the specified
  keys.  An example of a key specification is "\C-n", normally bound to
  `next-line', or "\M-\C-n", normally bound to `forward-list'.

  Because key bindings tends to be a largely personal issue, the default value
  of `ttn-select-global-keys' is `(only)', which effectively disables all key
  rebindings done by loading keys.el.  Do `C-h v ttn-select-global-keys' for
  more info.

- A bug was fixed in the command `multi-shell' which caused spurious
  initialization when switching to a pre-existing shell.

- You can interact w/ a spreadsheet for tuning PLL input numbers by doing `M-x
  pll-ss'.  A buffer is prepared with the parameters.  After editing the
  parameters, type `C-c C-c' to form a table and bin the entries by 5.  Type
  `C-h m' in the spreadsheet buffer for more info.  WARNING: The actual
  formula is incorrect at this time.

- Files ending in ".th" are now edited using `scheme-mode'.

- The command `what-defun-am-i-in' normally bound to `M-?' in programming
  modes, now understands Scheme mode.

- Maintenance commands `ttn-make-autoload-file', `ttn-make-subdirs-file' and
  `ttn-make-readme-files' are now available.  These are probably not useful
  w/o the RCS subdirectories.

- In comint and derived modes, `M-C-g' now runs the command `go'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.15 -- 1998/01/22

- Apparently, Emacs 20 did away w/ the Dired bindings for `*', `/' and `@'.
  These are now restored.

- You can now run locate(1) by doing `M-x locate'.  From a program, `locate'
  accepts a string to concat w/ "locate" to form the command passed to the
  shell.  See `shell-command'.

- The "go-file" programming environment convention is now in place.  This
  convention applies to sessions where there is an active inferior command
  interpreter (via `comint-mode').  Typing `M-x go' arranges for the command
  interpreter to load `go-file'.  For some programming modes this is now bound
  to `M-C-g'.

  Currently, the convention is: the go-file's first toggle-able enable (point
  of control) is called the "load bit".

  Two commands are now available to manipulate this bit: `glt' and `glf',
  whose names are acronyms for "go load true" and "go load false".

- Source code commonly grows in its data.  Tags on where to add additional
  entries into a table typically look like the comment "Add data here.".  This
  is a conventional editing target, part of the programming philosophy, so to
  speak.  All applicable source in this library now follows this convention.

  For programming modes using `my-prog-env', the key sequence `C-c M-C-h' now
  does a search for the regular expression "here[.!]$".  The search reports if
  no such tag is found, and also reports when it wraps to the beginning of the
  buffer.

  The punctuation after "here" affords some syntax that helps the search.  (We
  allow some chance for excitement, after all.)

- In GNUS, the summary buffer responds to `[' and `]' by scrolling the window
  horizontally left and right, respectively.

- The command `M-x turn-on-gnuserv' turns on whichever version of server is
  available to the current Emacs.  (Lucid Emacs uses "gnuserv" proper, whereas
  FSF Emacs uses the older "server" package.  We call both "gnuserv" here.)
  Turning on a server allows other processes to derive use from the currently
  running Emacs.

  For further information, look at these manual pages: emacscient(1),
  gnuattach(1), gnuclient(1).

- For programming modes, the sequence `C-c d' inserts a date and time stamp.
  The stamp is formatted w/ the string bug: "%Y.%m%d.%T%z".  Representative
  output would be, e.g., "1997.1107.21:34:10-0800".

- Under a windowing system that supports different fonts, you can use the
  command `M-x xlsfonts' to select one as the default font.  If point is at a
  valid font name, you can set it as default by `M-x set-font-at-point'.  If
  it turns out point is not on a valid font name, Emacs will call `xlsfonts'
  for you to choose.

- When using `isearch', in a similar way that `C-w' works for words, the key
  `C-y' works for structured expressions.  See the command `forward-sexp' for
  more information.  (Note that this works also for single symbols.)

- A bug was fixed in the command `electric-buffer-list'.  The display was not
  correctly substituting environment variables.  Now it does.

For programming:

- The function `idx-of' returns the zero-based index of an item found in a
  list.  Comparison is done w/ `equal'.  E.g., (idx-of 3 '(5 4 3)) => 2.

- The new variable `emacs-type' records either `lucid' or `fsf'.  Some people
  think "FSF Emacs" is derogatory, but I disagree.  (IMHO, "Lucid Emacs" just
  sounds better, anyway -- the obvious development paradigm difference is of
  academic debate. :->)

  The function `emacs-version=' no longer exists, but in its place is a more
  useful `emacs-version-at-least'.

- Alias `d.' to `defun'.  This is to help elisp-scheme unification.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.14 -- 1998/01/04

- A bug was fixed where `C-a' in scheme-mode and inferior-scheme-mode did the
  wrong thing.

- A bug was fixed in the command `M-x help-show-headers', normally bound to
  `C-h h', in which the keybindings in the *Headers* buffer were not being set
  correctly.

  The regexp used to discern headers now are more robust -- headers can have
  whitespace and the string to be displayed in the selection window need not
  start w/ a comment.

  Typing `q' in the selection window now closes the window.

- A bug was fixed for `M-x run-guile' and `M-x run-guile-tcltk' where the
  variable `scheme-buffer' was not being set to point to the newly created
  buffer, preventing use of the commands `scheme-send-definition' (normally
  bound to `C-M-x' in Scheme mode) and `scheme-send-definition-and-go'
  (normally bound to `M-m' in Scheme mode).

- `M-o' now ignores iconified frames.

For programming:

- The function `line-at-point' is now re-implemnted using `beginning-of-line'
  and `end-of-line' rather than a regexp search.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.13 -- 1997/12/26

- For both GNU Emacs and XEmacs, the directories /usr/info, /usr/local/info
  and ~/local/info are always added to the info search path.

- Directory environment variables "l", "ll", "L" and "LL" are set to various
  load-path favorites.  Variable "lo" is now known as "ll".  New variables are
  "c" and "s" for ~/codebits and scheme directories, respectively.

- When using Emacs 20 or higher, the file ~/.emacs-custom is loaded.  The
  variable `custom-file' is set to this for further use by `M-x customize'.

- Files ending in ".thud" are now edited using `scheme-mode'.

- When sending mail, a BCC header entry is automatically created with yourself
  as the recipient.  This is controlled by `mail-self-blind', a variable.  You
  may delete the field if you don't want all outgoing mail to be copied to you
  w/o reflecting it in other recipients' mail.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.12 -- 1997/12/25

- The command `munge-root-window' now also lists background jobs that can be
  killed by selecting them, in addition to the normal commands.  Also, Emacs
  now uses a window at the bottom of the screen to receive input (similar to
  `electric-buffer-list') instead of clearing the current window.

- When using RMAIL to read mail, you can now search back through the entire
  mail file for a regular expression by typing `M-r', which runs the command
  `rmail-search-backward'.  Emacs will ask you for a regexp to find.  You can
  type `RET' to accept the previous entry, or enter a new regexp.  If the
  search is successful, the RMAIL buffer will show the message found with
  point at the regexp.

- The command `M-x bg-shell-command' now accepts a prefix arg.  If non-nil,
  Emacs will switch to the buffer controlling the background job so that you
  can watch its progress.  Currently, you need to type `M-<' then `M->' to see
  anything useful because of (not-yet understood) weirdness w/ the mark.  If
  the prefix arg is nil, show nothing.

- A new command `M-x ping' allows you to ping a host.  Emacs switches to the
  buffer doing the ping so that you can watch.  A numerical prefix arg sets
  the interval of the ping, which defaults to 1 second.

- Turning on hilit19 via `M-x turn-on-hilit19' no longer overrides the
  definitions of `recenter', `yank' and `yank-pop'.

- A bug was fixed that set `Info-default-directory-list' for XEmacs wrongly.

- On a Linux console, you now can browse the different console fonts via a
  Dired extension.  Type `M-x browse-console-fonts'.  In the resulting dired
  buffer, hitting `RET' will run setfont(1) on the file at point.  (Be careful
  where you put point, or you may render your console unusable.)

- When using `my-prog-env', you can surround the source text in the buffer w/
  RCS tags w/ `M-#'.  Default styles are elisp, shell and c++; these are also
  used by related modes.  For example, scheme-mode will use elisp style.

- The mode-line no longer contains references to MULE or frames.  These items
  take up space that is better used for displaying other information.

- This library now includes sure-tags.el v1.0, by Bob Glickstein
  <bobg@zanshin.com>.  This package advises tag-related commands in useful
  ways.  For example, you can automatically update arbitrary TAGS files,
  before referencing them.

For programming:

- The function `border' is now available.  It has this kind of behavior:

    (border 3 '(1 2 3 4 5))
    => (2 3 4 5)

  Basically, given break ELEMENT, return a sublist that starts with the
  element right before.  This is useful if conjunction w/ `setcdr' for list
  splitting.

- The command `source-wrap-elisp-style' has been generalized to `source-wrap'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.11 -- 1997/12/15

- You can now start and interact with a guile process through buffer *guile*
  using the command `run-guile'.  This is based on `run-scheme' and the buffer
  prepared is based on `comint-mode', so `M-p' (`comint-previous-input') and
  `M-n' (`comint-next-input') work as expected.  Type `C-h f comint-mode RET'
  for more information.  The executable "guile" should be in your PATH
  environment variable.

- Similarly, `M-x run-guile-tcltk' is now available.

- The command `insert-separator' now knows about Scheme mode.

- You can get a root shell by typing `M-x su-shell'.  Emacs prompts you for
  the root password and with it sets up a `multi-shell'.  Current directory
  remains unchanged.

- Under `ttn-elisp-home', new files lisp/README and lisp/low-stress/README
  provide brief (but not yet comprehensive) descriptions of the elisp code
  found therein.  Also, ./README now has "ls -lRt" output, not just .el files.

- In `shell-mode' and for `run-scheme', `run-lisp', `run-guile' and
  `run-guile-tcltk', the key `C-a' now moves the cursor to the end of the
  prompt (where you would normally begin typing) rather than to the absolute
  beginning of the line.

- A bug was fixed in the command `dired-compile-last-change-log' used from
  Dired mode, whereby Emacs was failing to find the "Working file" RCS tag.

- The command `C-x m' composes mail, as before, but now queries you first for
  contents of the "To:" and "Subject:" fields.  Typing RET in response is OK.
  A buffer is created with the name "*mail TO*", where TO was your response.
  If this buffer already exists, confirm if you want to kill it.  If so, the
  new TO and SUBJECT are inserted; otherwise you may continue w/ the previous
  mailing.

  As usual `C-c C-c' sends the mail and buries the buffer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.10 -- 1997/12/04

- When using `my-prog-env', you can find out what defun, function or module
  you are "in" with `M-?', which calls `what-defun-am-i-in'.  Emacs looks
  backward in the buffer for the name of the syntactic unit and informs you in
  the minibuffer.  This is useful if the name is not on the screen and you
  don't want to leave your current place in the buffer.

- The code to cleanup Macintosh "Word" documents no longer asks for a file.
  Instead, it operates on the current buffer.  Also, the command has been
  renamed to `macintosh-word-cleanup' and is autoloaded.

- The amusement that calls fortune(1) no longer is started automatically by
  this library.  You can invoke it manually using `M-x fortunate-loop', which
  also causes `fortunate-loop' to be hooked into the idle timer.

For programming:

- The aliases `_u', `_s', `_swb' and `_swbow' are no longer available.  You
  should use `force-mode-line-update', `sit-for', `switch-to-buffer' and
  `switch-to-buffer-other-window', respectively.

- Directory environment variables "l", "lo" and "L" are set only for
  interactive use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.9

- The command `what-defun-am-i-in' now autoloads correctly.

- If you are in a buffer you can mail it to someone using `C-x RET RET'.  This
  will place you in the mail buffer with the contents of the original buffer
  as the mail.  Fill out the "To" and "Subject" fields and type `C-c C-c' to
  send.  After sending, Emacs will return to the original buffer.

  If you want to cancel the mail, just kill the mail buffer.  Alternatively,
  you can use `C-x b RET' to get back to the original buffer.

- This NEWS file, normally kept in `ttn-elisp-home', is now available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.8

First public release.  This includes many many many features and probably a
few bugs.  :->

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
