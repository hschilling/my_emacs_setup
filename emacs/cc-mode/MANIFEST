You should have received the following files in the distribution tar
file for cc-mode 4.85:

    MANIFEST: This file

    cc-mode.el: Version 4.85 of the mode.

    cc-compat.el: version 1.2.  Helps ease the transition from
    c-mode.el to cc-mode style indentation control.  This is provided
    for your convenience only, and is completely unguaranteed and
    unsupported.

    cc-mode-18.el: Emacs 18 compatibility file.  This is provided for
    your convenience only, and is completely unguaranteed and
    unsupported.  Emacs 18 support will probably be completely dropped
    in cc-mode version 5.

    README: manual on how to use cc-mode to edit C, C++, and
    Objective-C files. Eventually this will be replaced by a texinfo
    manual.  VOLUNTEERS ARE SOUGHT to help complete the manual.

    DUMPING: A guide to ditching c-mode.el and c++-mode.el in favor of
    cc-mode.el.  Unnecessary for XEmacs 19.11!  Yay!

    ChangeLog: Extremely verbose history of changes.
