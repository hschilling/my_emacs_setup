I'm never sure if I save any labor by trying to write labor-saving devices,
but at least writing this was a less repetitive than typing in the same
long pathnames over and over and over again.

;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides several shortcut commands for visiting or
;; inserting files without having to specify them by their complete name.
;; For example, you can visit emacs lisp libraries, programs in your
;; exec-path (some of which are humanly-readable shell scripts or config
;; files), or anything else which is quickly locatable via a prebuilt
;; database or path list.

;; Using a prefix arg will display a menu of all possible matches,
;; and you can select one of them by moving point and pressing return.

;; There are also documented subroutines for common searching operations
;; and basic interactive behavior to minimize any effort required to add
;; additional shortcut commands.

;; To use this package, put the following in your .emacs:
;;
;;     (autoload 'fff-find-emacs-lisp-library         "fff" nil t)
;;     (autoload 'fff-insert-emacs-lisp-library       "fff" nil t)
;;     (autoload 'fff-locate-emacs-lisp-library       "fff" nil t)
;;     (autoload 'fff-find-loaded-emacs-lisp-function "fff" nil t)
;;     (autoload 'fff-find-file-in-envvar-path        "fff" nil t)
;;     (autoload 'fff-insert-file-in-envvar-path      "fff" nil t)
;;     (autoload 'fff-find-file-in-exec-path          "fff" nil t)
;;     (autoload 'fff-insert-file-in-exec-path        "fff" nil t)
;;     (autoload 'fff-find-file-in-path               "fff" nil t)
;;     (autoload 'fff-insert-file-in-path             "fff" nil t)
;;     (autoload 'fff-find-file-in-locate-db          "fff" nil t)
;;     (autoload 'fff-insert-file-in-locate-db        "fff" nil t)
;;
;; The command `fff-install-map' will bind these commands to a common
;; prefix of "C-c C-f" (you can change this).  To find a list of them, run
;; that command and then type "C-c C-f C-h".
;;
;; If you are using Emacs 19, you can have this happen automatically by
;; putting the following in your .emacs:
;;
;;     (eval-after-load "fff" '(fff-install-map))

;; I wrote this package I got sick of typing long file names for things way
;; down in source trees, or having to go look for them first because I
;; didn't even know where they were.  This package is called fff.el because
;; originally it stood for "friedman-find-file" for lack of a better name.

;; It's most generally useful if you have an up-to-date `locate' database
;; (built by the `updatedb' program from the GNU findutils), since that
;; provides a fast way to search for files by name all over the system.

(defvar fff-locate-program-args nil
  "*Additional args to the program which searches the `locate' database.

If `nil', no predicate is used; all files match.

This variable only used by interactive commands defined in this package.

Utilitity functions in this package which take a predicate argument do not
refer to this variable for a default; if no predicate is specified, none is
used and all files match.")

This is used by `fff-display-matches'.")
